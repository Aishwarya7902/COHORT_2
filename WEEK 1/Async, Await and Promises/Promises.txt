✅ Earlier , if there were 2 Async operations and they were dependent on each other , we used callbacks for it.

  But...But.........But
In this method we are blindly trusting some other function to call our function.......But this is not reliable...what if that function doesn't call our callback
In order to solve this issue , Developer introduced callbacks.

✅ const promise = createOrder(cart)

 this above line returns us an empty promise ....with some data as a property and having undefined value.

   // { 
        data : undefined;
      }
Once the createOreder() API comes back.....undefined is replaced by the returned value.


✅ What are promises ?❤️

  -> A promise is a special object that represents eventual completion or failure of an asyn operation.
  -> A promise has only 3 states pending,fulfilled or rejected.
  -> Promises are immutable.

✅ What is CallBack Hell ?

  when one API depends on another and then that on another ..and so on and so forth...our code grows horizontally instead of growing vertically. 
  This is called callback hell.

✅Promise Chaining
